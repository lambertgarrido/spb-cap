    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Q4. In bootstrap approach, permutations of data is taken 100,000 times and the observed difference in callbacks between both groups are calculated for each permutation. From this set of permuations, a distribution is created with the 95% confidence interval, mean, and error shown above. The p-value returned is 1 part in 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In frequentist approach, I assume that the distribution of callbacks across all groups has a mean and standard deviation from entire data sample. Assuming CLT, the distribution of percent callback is a normal distribution with mean equal to sample mean and standard deviation equal to sample standard deviation divided by square root of sample size. Given this distribution, I calculate a p-value for the black and white group observed percent callback. The p value of observing the given percent callbacks for each of the groups is the product of the individual group p values. The p-value returned is 2 parts in 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches returned a p-value much less than 0.01. Therefore, the observed difference in callbacks for white and black groups is statistical significant. On average, the white group has a higher percent callback value than the black group.\n",
