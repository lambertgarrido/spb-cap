In this project, the monthly housing cost is predicted by applying several supervised machine learning models available in the Python scikit-learn library. A potential home buyer could benefit from this machine learning application by providing the user a cost estimate of a property before closing the deal. Government agencies could use this application to identify homes in financial distress in a given region, thereby influencing their policy decisions.
